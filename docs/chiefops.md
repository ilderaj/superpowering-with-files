# ChiefOps

`ChiefOps` is a narrow governance capability for tracked tasks in SWF.

It adds:

- a local skill: `harness/core/skills/chiefops/`
- a derived runtime reader: `harness/runtime/chiefops-service.mjs`
- a read-only MCP tool: `harness_chiefops_board`

It does not add:

- a second durable memory system
- a new workflow lane or mode family
- a runner, scheduler, daemon, or long-lived manager
- a ChiefOps-specific receipt dialect

## Authority And Truth

ChiefOps stays grounded in the same truth surfaces that already exist:

- `planning/active/<task-id>/` is the only durable task-memory root
- `.harness/execution/receipts/<taskId>/*.json` remains execution truth
- follow-up closures remain the source for resolved or waived receipt followups
- the existing Mode-Aware Verification Contract vocabulary remains the proof language

The runtime board is fully derived. It does not persist `chiefops-status.json`, board markdown, or any task-local cache.

## Current V1 Surfaces

### Skill

Use the `chiefops` skill when a tracked task needs a bounded governance pass before the next execution slice. The skill is for readout and framing, not orchestration automation.

### Runtime Board

`getChiefOpsBoard({ root, taskId })` derives a task-scoped governance view from:

- active-task summary data
- execution receipt summaries
- the current task plan's recorded proof target, when available

The board currently returns:

- `taskId`
- `status`
- `chiefOpsDeclared`
- `lane`
- `proofTarget`
- `latestReceipt`
- `executionSignals`
- `blockedSignals`
- `reconciliationStatus`
- `derivedRisk`
- `recommendedNextAction`

### MCP

Use the read-only MCP tool:

```text
harness_chiefops_board
```

with:

```json
{ "taskId": "<task-id>" }
```

It returns the structured board plus a compact text summary.

## Current Limits

V1 is intentionally narrow.

- `swf-simplify: no CLI surface in V1; ceiling=read via runtime service or read-only MCP only; upgrade trigger=multiple real operator workflows need a shell entrypoint that MCP cannot cover cleanly`

That means:

- there is no `./scripts/harness chiefops ...` command yet
- write-mode MCP tools remain out of scope
- board state must stay traceable to planning files, receipts, and closures

## Recommended Use

Reach for ChiefOps when you need to answer:

- What is the current governance state of this tracked task?
- Is the next problem an execution issue, plan issue, or proof issue?
- What is the next bounded slice that still respects current authority and receipt truth?

Do not use ChiefOps to replace `goal-writer`, `goal2plan`, `autonomous-release-closure`, or the existing workflow lanes.
